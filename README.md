## Description
This project is a JSON-XML converter that allows you to convert data between JSON and XML formats. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are both commonly used formats for storing and exchanging data. JSON is often used in web development and APIs, while XML has a broader range of applications, including data storage and document representation.

## Features
- Conversion between JSON and XML: The converter supports converting data from JSON format to XML format and vice versa.
- Object-oriented design: The project follows an object-oriented programming approach, utilizing classes and inheritance to organize and structure the code.
- Readability and usability: The converter ensures that the converted data is readable by both computers and humans, maintaining the structure and integrity of the original data.
- Support for nested structures: The converter handles nested structures in JSON and XML, allowing you to convert complex data hierarchies accurately.
- Error handling: The converter includes error handling mechanisms to handle cases where the input data is not valid JSON or XML.

## Usage
To use the JSON-XML converter, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (see Dependencies section).
2. Prepare your input data in either JSON or XML format.
3. In the main method of the servicing.JSONXMLConverter class, specify the file path of your input data.
4. Run the program.
5. The converter will automatically detect the input format and convert it to the opposite format.
6. The converted data will be printed to the console.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    new servicing.JSONXMLConverter().run();
}
```
Please note that this project uses the Scanner class to read input from a file. Make sure to update the file path in the Scanner constructor to match your specific file location.

To run the Project4JSON-XMLConverter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file, perform the following steps:

1. Download the JAR file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt: Navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located.
3. Run the JAR file: Enter the following command to execute the JAR file:
```shell
java -jar Project4JSON-XMLConverter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions: The program will display a menu with different options. Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired action.

## Feedback
During the development of the JSON-XML converter project, I gained valuable knowledge and experience in various areas. Firstly, I deepened my understanding of JSON and XML as data formats and their significance in storing data in a readable manner for both humans and computers. I learned about the differences between these formats and the challenges involved in converting data from one format to another.

Additionally, this project provided me with an opportunity to enhance my skills in working with collections, such as lists and streams, which are essential for processing and manipulating data effectively. I also strengthened my grasp of object-oriented programming principles by implementing classes, inheritance, and composition in the converter project.

Throughout the project, I encountered several difficulties that tested my problem-solving abilities. For instance, understanding and implementing the parsing and formatting logic for both JSON and XML required careful consideration and attention to detail. However, by breaking down the problem into smaller components and leveraging the provided code structure, I was able to overcome these challenges and successfully implement the converter functionality.

Overall, this project served as a platform for me to consolidate my knowledge of data formats, collections, and object-oriented programming. It challenged me to think critically, analyze complex problems, and devise efficient solutions. Through this experience, I have not only improved my technical skills but also developed resilience and perseverance when faced with programming challenges.
